<h1><a href="/about.html">About ergo-cms</a></h1>
<p>Ergo was written, mainly to scratch an <strong>itch</strong>. I had been waiting for several years for Jekyll, Hyde, Ghost, etc, etc to make some realisations:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Not everybody likes markdown!</li>
	<li>Where is a nice gui to do stuff?</li>
</ul>
<p>This project originally started as a C++ static website generator. It used markdown&#8230; but then I found <a href="http://txstyle.org">Textile</a> and then ported it to <code>node.js</code> as quickly as my fingers could type. I think it took a few hours. At one point I gave some notion to refactoring a lot of the code and got 99% of the way, but it wasn&#8217;t production ready. That code exists still, but is horrible and clunky and not extensible. <br />
This project is the 4th generation of something that no-one else other than myself has seen.</p>
<p>This is what ergo-cms is:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A <strong>very</strong> lightweight cms. I was shocked to discover than an install of Ghost currently clocks in at around 185MB! Ergo doesn&#8217;t use <strong>anyone</strong> elses fancy modules, unless it&#8217;s vital. Hence there&#8217;s no mustache, less, or any of that stuff here.</li>
	<li>Very extensible. If you like you <strong>can</strong> use mustache, or less, etc.</li>
	<li>Database-less. It uses flat files. It natively supports Markdown (for those who haven&#8217;t seen the light), and Textile (for those that have). Being very extensible, it can support a whatever you can dream up.</li>
	<li>Great at creating static websites.</li>
	<li>Great at publishing minimal changes to your webserver (using rsync)</li>
</ul>
<p>What ergo-cms isn&#8217;t:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A Jekyll, WordPress, or &lt;insert your cms name here&gt; replacement.</li>
	<li>A web server. Although there&#8217;s the ability to view your files in a locally hosted server (http:localhost:8181), it&#8217;s nothing more than a simple file server &amp; not production hardened. There&#8217;s no reason for such a thing, with a flat file generator.</li>
	<li>Supportive of ruby-esque things. <span class="caps">YAML</span> is one of the most crazy things I&#8217;ve ever seen. But people like coffee script too. If you want to write a plugin, by all means, it&#8217;ll work nicely here &#8211; but I won&#8217;t write it. I&#8217;m not a fan of fan-boi-itis. By supporting markdown, I believe supported enough of all of <em>that</em> kind of craziness, &amp; won&#8217;t go a step further!</li>
</ul>
<p>What it will (eventually) do:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Have two admin interfaces: one running on php that &#8216;prods&#8217; a version of ergo-cli, and another that uses express (or something)</li>
	<li>Have an offline editor. This will be a &#8216;distraction free&#8217; app, with very minimal toys. It will probably run with electron and be <em>beautiful</em> to behold (because sometimes you need to be inspired when writing, I&#8217;ve found).</li>
</ol>
<p>So, there you have it. Ergo is yet another flat file cms static website generator, but is easy to use and has plans to have a proper admin interface and offline editor.</p>
