Ergo was written, mainly to scratch an _itch_. I had been waiting for several years for Jekyll, Hyde, Ghost, etc, etc to make some realisations:

* Not everybody likes markdown, and it generates pretty boring content!
* Where is a nice gui to do stuff?
* I can't sail around the ocean without taking a fat development environment to write my pages. I need an app.

This project originally started as a C++ static website generator before node.js was even born. It used markdown... 
Then "node.js":http://nodejs.org came along and I found "Textile":http://txstyle.org and then ported it to node.js as quickly as my fingers could type. I think it took a few hours. 
At one point I gave some notion to refactoring a lot of the code and got 99% of the way, but realised it was all spectacularly ill-designed. It wasn't production ready, and my websites have limped along since then.
That code exists still, but is horrible and clunky and not extensible.[1]

Seeing the rise and rise of various static generators, I was dismayed to see them not satisfy the abovementioned points.[2]

So, this project is the 4th generation of something that has never otherwise seen the light of day.


This is what ergo-cms is:

* A _very_ lightweight cms. I was shocked to discover than an install of Ghost currently clocks in at around 185MB! Ergo doesn't use _anyone_ else's fancy modules, unless it's vital. Hence there's no mustache, less, or any of that stuff here. (plugins for those will come, however).
* Very extensible. If you like you _can_ use mustache, or less, etc.
* Database-less. It uses flat files. It natively supports Markdown (for those who haven't seen the light), and Textile (for those that have). Being very extensible, it can support a whatever you can dream up.
* Great at creating static websites. 
* Great at publishing minimal changes to your webserver (using rsync, or git)


What ergo-cms isn't:

* A Jekyll, WordPress, or _<insert your cms name here>_ replacement.
* A web server. Although there's the ability to view your files in a locally hosted server (http:localhost:8181), it's nothing more than a simple file server & not production hardened. There's no reason for such a thing, with a flat file generator.
* Supportive of ruby-esque things. YAML is one of the most crazy things I've ever seen. But people like coffee script too. If you want to write a plugin for _<insert your markup language here>_, by all means, it'll work nicely - but I won't write it. I'm not a fan of fan-boi-itis. By supporting markdown, I believe supported enough of all of _that_ kind of craziness, & won't go a step further... unless it's LaTeX -- I've heard good things with it. So, I might write a LateX plugin. I won't write an scss plugin though (because it's a ruby thing).

What it will (eventually) do:

# Have two admin interfaces: one running on php that uses ergo-cli (ie, with node installed on the server), and another that uses express (or something) so that you can just serve it - as is.
# Have an offline editor. This will be a 'distraction free' app, with very minimal toys. It will probably run with "Electron":http://electron.atom.io/ and be _beautiful_ to behold (because sometimes you need to be inspired when writing, I've found). A mobile app will use "Cordova":http://cordova.apache.org/ and/or a touch of "Ionic":http://ionicframework.com/. 
#* They'll require some comms extensions (DAV/SFTP/rsync/convoluted git hook/custom) to be figured out first.
# Have a slew of plugins that can be downloaded and configured easily. I was thinking something a bit 'npm-ish', like: @ergo install plugin-name@. The actual mechanics of this will be ironed out later.
# Have a Theme repository. n00bs love this stuff. Designers avoid them, except to sell them, of course ;). At the moment, I'll ship a few skeleton projects that should solve the 99% of websites. Hopefully.


So, there you have it. Ergo is yet another flat file cms static website generator, but is easy to use and has plans to have a proper admin interface and offline/mobile editor.

fn1(small). I actually wrote it on a Galaxy Tab 2 7" while backpacking through Spain, on a rooted Android with a debian/xfce platform & jacked in with a mini keyboard attachment. Fun times.

fn2(small).  The continued use of ruby dismays me still. Ruby and I don't get along. We never have. I tried. But I started with assembler (motorla/intel) and didn't see the need for such a language. If you love it, great. I don't, and I never will.
