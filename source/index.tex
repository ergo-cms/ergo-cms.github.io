h1={margin:2em auto}. ergo-cms is in it's infancy and will be live soon. You are welcome to follow the code on "github":https://github.com/ergo-cms/.

If you're impatient, you can try playing with the skeleton file:

bc. npm install ergo -g
ergo init Blog
cd Blog
ergo view -b -w

Don't like the theme? Try Smart Bootstrap's 'Clean Blog':

bc. ergo theme install clean-blog
ergo view -c -b -w

Switch back the original them? 

bc. ergo theme switch ergo-simple
ergo view -c -b -w

Don't want to install globally? No problem:

bc. git clone https://github.com/ergo-cms/ergo-skel.git Blog
cd Blog
npm install
npm run ergo -- view -b -w

Just use @npm run ergo --  ...@ in place of running @ergo ...@ for all commands!

fn1{margin-top:5em;}(small). ∴ is the mathematical symbol for 'therefore'
