Ergo is easy. It is light. It is fast. It is ∴ effortless. This site is built with it, with minimal fuss, but amazing control. Check out the "Docs":/articles.html, "Themes":/themes.html or "Plugins":/plugins.html.

h2. Installation and Getting Started

You'll need node.js to be installed first. If you don't have node installed, then head over to "nodejs":https://nodejs.org/en/ and download an LTS version. Ergo supports version 4.x and 6.x and is regularly tested on them.

Try playing with the skeleton file:

bc. npm install ergo-cli -g
ergo init Blog
cd Blog
ergo view -b -w

Don't like the theme? Try Smart Bootstrap's 'Clean Blog' (or "view more here":https://ergo-cms.github.io/themes):

bc. ergo theme install clean-blog
ergo view -c -b -w

Switch back the original theme? 

bc. ergo theme switch ergo-simple
ergo view -c -b -w

Don't want to install globally? No problem:

bc. git clone https://github.com/ergo-cms/ergo-skel.git Blog
cd Blog
npm install
npm run ergo -- view -b -w

Just use @npm run ergo --  ...@ in place of running @ergo ...@ for all commands!
