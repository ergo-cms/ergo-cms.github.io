Ergo, I Write.

h2. Getting Started

* Install Ergo. (Ironically, this is optional)

bc. npm install ergo-cli -g

* Download a skeleton project from "https://github.com/ergo-cms/ergo-skel". Other skeletons will become available. Then change to that folder.

OR, use @ergo-cli@ to download the basic skeleton for you:

bc. ergo init Blog
cd Blog

* Start the local webserver, in 'watch' mode:

bc. ergo view --watch

* Open your browser to http://localhost:8181

h2. Deploying

When you're ready:

bc. ergo deploy

(You'll need to set some info in config.ergo.js first!)
